# react-instant-chat-tutorial
A skeleton version of the react-instant-chat app. It contains no React code and allows the reader to follow along with the tutorial located on the CoderFactory blog

To start the app, run:

```
npm install 

npm start
```

Once the webpack server has started you can access it in a browser at http://localhost:8000

Ensure that you also have the [simple-chat-api](https://github.com/kentandlime/simple-chat-api) running as well
